# Final-Project
Final project that was done in my class at ASU
I created this as spec project of a something I could use at work. A DTM (data transfer module) is used to record flight information, to include faults, from the aircraft and then it is fed in to the computer. I have to search this information for certain faults so I decided create a small program that could parse out information.
